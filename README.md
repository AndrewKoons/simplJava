simplJava - S.IM.PL in Java
=========

S.IM.PL is an architecture that aims to let you simply transfer information between programming languages. 
(Ideally with no muss, no fuss, and little boilerplate!)

How does it do this? It allows you to:
-Serialize *everything* into *every* format 
-Deserialize *every* format into the language of your choice
-Translate your object representations accross languages.
