He is best known for co-founding the Cubist movement and for the wide variety of styles embodied in his work. Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d&#39;Avignon (1907) and Guernica (1937), his portrayal of the German bombing of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War.">

Born in the city of M&#195;&#161;laga in the Andalusian region of Spain, he was the first child of Don Jos&#195;&#169; Ruiz y Blasco (1838&#226;&#8364;&#8220;1913) and Mar&#195;&#173;a Picasso y L&#195;&#179;pez.[3] Picasso&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s family was middle-class; his father was also a painter who specialized in naturalistic depictions of birds and other game. For most of his life Ruiz was a professor of art at the School of Crafts and a curator of a local museum. Ruiz&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s ancestors were minor aristocrats.">

Picasso thrived in the city, regarding it in times of sadness or nostalgia as his true home.[7] Ruiz persuaded the officials at the academy to allow his son to take an entrance exam for the advanced class. This process often took students a month, but Picasso completed it in a week, and the impressed jury admitted Picasso, who was 13. The student lacked discipline but made friendships that would affect him in later life. His father rented him a small room close to home so Picasso could work alone, yet Ruiz checked up on him numerous times a day, judging his son&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s drawings. The two argued frequently.">

Madrid, however, held many other attractions: the Prado housed paintings by the venerable Diego Vel&#195;&#161;zquez, Francisco Goya, and Francisco Zurbar&#195;&#161;n.

							paragraph_text="After studying art in Madrid, Picasso made his first trip to Paris in 1900, then the art capital of Europe. There, he met his first Parisian friend, the journalist and poet Max Jacob, who helped Picasso learn the language and its literature. Soon they shared an apartment; Max slept at night while Picasso slept during the day and worked at night. These were times of severe poverty, cold, and desperation. Much of his work was burned to keep the small room warm. During the first five months of 1901, Picasso lived in Madrid, where he and his anarchist friend Francisco de As&#195;&#173;s Soler founded the magazine Arte Joven (Young Art), which published five issues. Soler solicited articles and Picasso illustrated the journal, mostly contributing grim cartoons depicting and sympathizing with the state of the poor. The first issue was published on 31 March 1901, by which time the artist had started to sign his work simply Picasso, while before he had signed Pablo Ruiz y Picasso.[9]">

The Steins introduced him to Claribel Cone and her sister Etta who were American art collectors; they also began to acquire Picasso and Matisse&#39;s paintings.

							paragraph_text="After World War I, Picasso made a number of important relationships with figures associated with Serge Diaghilev&#39;s Ballets Russes. Among his friends during this period were Jean Cocteau, Jean Hugo, Juan Gris and others. In the summer of 1918, Picasso married Olga Khokhlova, a ballerina with Sergei Diaghilev&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s troupe, for whom Picasso was designing a ballet, Parade, in Rome; and they spent their honeymoon in the villa near Biarritz of the glamorous Chilean art patron Eugenia Err&#195;&#161;zuriz. Khokhlova introduced Picasso to high society, formal dinner parties, and all the social niceties attendant on the life of the rich in 1920s Paris. The two had a son, Paulo, who would grow up to be a dissolute motorcycle racer and chauffeur to his father. Khokhlova&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s insistence on social propriety clashed with Picasso&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s bohemian tendencies and the two lived in a state of constant conflict. During the same period that Picasso collaborated with Diaghilev&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s troup, he and Igor Stravinsky collaborated on Pulcinella in 1920. Picasso took the opportunity to make several drawings of the composer.">

As a Spanish citizen living in France, Picasso was under no compulsion to fight against the invading Germans in either World War. In the Spanish Civil War, service for Spaniards living abroad was optional and would have involved a voluntary return to the country to join either side. While Picasso expressed anger and condemnation of Francisco Franco and fascists through his art, he did not take up arms against them. He also remained aloof from the Catalan independence movement during his youth despite expressing general support and being friendly with activists within it.">

In a 1945 interview with Jerome Seckler, Picasso stated: &#226;&#8364;&#339;I am a Communist and my painting is Communist painting. ... But if I were a shoemaker, Royalist or Communist or anything else, I would not necessarily hammer my shoes in a special way to show my politics.&#226;&#8364;[22] His Communist militancy, not uncommon among intellectuals and artists at the time although it was officially banned in Francoist Spain, has long been the subject of some controversy; a notable source or demonstration thereof was a sarcastic quote commonly attributed to Salvador Dal&#195;&#173; (with whom Picasso had a rather strained relationship[23]), ostensibly casting doubt on the true honesty of his political allegiances:">

In the same year, at the age of 14, he painted Portrait of Aunt Pepa, a vigorous and dramatic portrait that Juan-Eduardo Cirlot has called &#226;&#8364;&#339;without a doubt one of the greatest in the whole history of Spanish painting.&#226;&#8364;[36]">

This period&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s starting point is uncertain; it may have begun in Spain in the spring of 1901, or in Paris in the second half of the year.[38] Many paintings of gaunt mothers with children date from this period.

The harlequin, a comedic character usually depicted in checkered patterned clothing, became a personal symbol for Picasso. Picasso met Fernande Olivier, a model for sculptors and artists, in Paris in 1904, and many of these paintings are influenced by his warm relationship with her, in addition to his increased exposure to French painting. The generally upbeat and optimistic mood of paintings in this period is reminiscent of the 1899&#226;&#8364;&#8220;1901 period (i.e. just prior to the Blue Period) and 1904 can be considered a transition year between the two periods.">

					context="In his life time, Picasso had already become a synonym for &#34;modern art.&#34; Today he still considered a myth, a legend of the arts; his poise as an artist is intricate and vibrant in a myriad of facets. Many persons played important roles in his life and have left us with testimonies. The abundance of existing documents about his life and his art, but above all to his individuality, allow us to access his art. Nevertheless, the formidable biographies are only a drop of information compared to the torrent of torrent of opinions, critiques, findings, and books about his arts for decades."

					context="See for instance &#34;The fourth dimension: toward a geometry of higher reality&#34; by Rudy Rucker, Houghton Mifflin, 1984."
					caption="Abstract art may be a 20th century creation, but it also marks the end of a process that started in the 18th century. Long before the invention of photography, philosophers began to question the narrative role of the art of painting, in which naturalism served to create an illusion of reality. Paintings would tell stories and depict actions and emotions; the content of a painting was its central feature, not the painting itself, with its form and color. This would be reversed by the influence of theoreticians like Denis Diderot, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Immanuel Kant and Arthur Schoppenhauer. They felt that the art of painting should not copy nature, but should be an independent art form; the purpose of a painting became the painting itself."
